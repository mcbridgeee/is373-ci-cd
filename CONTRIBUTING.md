# Contributing

This repository teaches development history as well as deployment. Prefer small, understandable changes with evidence over a large all-at-once implementation.

## Specification-driven workflow

1. Pick an open issue from the [implementation plan](docs/implementation-plan.md). Check its dependencies.
2. Read its linked specification sections and requirement IDs.
3. If behavior must change, update the specification and issue before or with the implementation. Explain the decision in the PR.
4. Create a branch such as `feat/3-quiz-scoring-logic` or `fix/9-answer-validation`.
5. Implement one coherent piece and run the relevant checks.
6. Make focused commits that reference the issue.
7. Open a PR with acceptance evidence, scope, and any untested limitations.
8. Merge when the issue's acceptance criteria are satisfied and required checks pass. A deployment issue also needs evidence from the running host.

The initial documentation bootstrap (issue 1) goes directly to the empty repository's `main` branch so the specifications and issue forms can be reviewed on GitHub. Subsequent implementation uses branches and PRs. This is a solo-maintainer demo, so no reviewer approval count is required — but once issue 6 lands, `main` requires an up-to-date passing `verify` check, including for the repo owner.

## Atomic commits

An atomic commit represents one coherent, reviewable change. A behavior change and its necessary tests usually belong together. Do not split a change just to increase the commit count, and do not combine unrelated fixes.

Suggested style:

```text
docs: specify quiz request/response contract (#1)
feat: add quiz scoring logic and unit tests (#3)
test: exercise quiz in Chromium (#4)
ci: publish verified container images (#6)
```

Use `Refs #N` while an issue is in progress and `Closes #N` in the completing PR. Preserve useful atomic commits using GitHub's merge-commit option; avoid squashing an entire implementation into one commit for this teaching repository. Review staged files before committing. Do not commit secrets, build output, local environment files, browser artifacts, or unrelated changes.

## Command interface

Start with `make setup` and `make browsers` when running tests locally.

| Command | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `make dev` | Start only the source-mounted dev service on `8080`; no published image required |
| `make test-unit` | Run only pure Python unit tests |
| `make test-integration` | Run only in-process API integration tests |
| `make build` | Build a release image with commit and build metadata; no publication |
| `make test-e2e` | Test the already-built image in an isolated container; collect failures and clean up |
| `make scan` | Scan the built image with the pinned Trivy; fails on fixable HIGH/CRITICAL (#16) |
| `make up` | Start dev, published prod, and WUD (local demonstration) |
| `make deploy` | Start only published prod and WUD; no build, no dev (the droplet). Honors a rollback pause and the local override |
| `make verify-production` | Check the running prod container's image ID and `/health` commit and environment against the selected release |
| `make check-updates` | Ask WUD to check Docker Hub now instead of waiting for its 5-minute poll |
| `make status` | Show running services, update state, selected prod image, and prod `/health` |
| `make down` | Stop this project's Compose services without deleting unrelated resources |
| `make rollback RELEASE=<sha-full-commit or sha256:digest>` | Pause WUD, pin prod to a known-good release in `.state/release.env`, verify it |
| `make resume-updates` | Return prod to the `prod` tag, verify it, then resume WUD |

`IMAGE` selects the locally built/tested image; `E2E_PORT` changes the isolated browser-test port.

## Validation and evidence

- Documentation: review consistency, relative links, requirement references, applicable YAML syntax; run `git diff --check`.
- Python logic/API: run the affected unit and integration tests.
- HTML/JavaScript: run browser checks against the production image.
- Docker/CI/updater: verify the actual image, runner, or host behavior as appropriate.
- Every PR: state exact checks run and material checks not run. Never label planned validation as passed.

Deliberate failure demonstrations belong on clearly named demo branches and should be documented. Do not leave a known broken release on `main` outside an explicitly coordinated failure demonstration.
